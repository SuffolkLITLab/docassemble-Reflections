Week,Reflection Question
2,"1. Choose a task of your choice (something you are very familiar with) to explain, and write out a plain language explanation that you could give to someone with a 6th grade education level. For example: how to change a flat tire; how to brew a cup of coffee with a French press; how to set up a wireless router. Use the website 'https://splasho.com/upgoer5/' to write your explanation using only the 1000 most common English language words. \n2. Considering the articles on plain language and legibility in legal documents, discuss how the principles outlined can transform legal communication. Are there specific challenges highlighted in the readings that resonate with you? How do you think that legal technology products should incorporate these principles? Why?"
3,"Given the efficiency gains and productivity improvements discussed so far in class, in this week's readings, and in the 2023 Legal Trends Report, particularly the impact of technology and AI on legal practice, how can tools like Docassemble be leveraged to not only build expert systems but also enhance client-centered legal services? Reflect on the potential challenges and ethical considerations that may arise when integrating such technologies into your practice."
4,"Considering the findings that generative AI tools can significantly enhance legal professionals' productivity and narrow the justice gap, how might the introduction of these tools reshape the professional responsibilities and ethical considerations of legal aid lawyers, particularly in managing risks associated with AI-generated content such as 'hallucinations' or biased outputs? Additionally, given the initial lower usage rates of AI tools among women and the significant improvement post-trial, what steps should legal aid organizations take to ensure equitable access and usage of these technologies across all demographics, including training and support systems to mitigate bias in AI applications"
5,"Considering the increasing trend towards low-code development platforms for legal document automation, such as Gavel, and open-source solutions like Docassemble, analyze the pros and cons of each approach in the context of legal services. How do these platforms differ in terms of customization capabilities, potential for vendor lock-in, and the ability to bridge skill gaps among legal professionals? Furthermore, discuss the implications of these differences for legal aid organizations aiming to implement technological solutions to increase access to justice as well as private law firms."

10,How does the term 'earliest testable product' (ETP) relate to the concept of 'minimum viable product' (MVP)? How do the readings suggest that ETPs and MVPs can be used to improve legal services? Discuss how the readings have influenced your perspective on the role of technology in legal practice. How might you apply these concepts in your final project?
11,"Before conducting a usability test, reflect on the primary objectives and methodologies of usability testing based on your studies. What specific aspects of the user experience are you most interested in evaluating, and why? Consider how the principles of effective design and user feedback can inform your approach to this test. How will you ensure that the test is structured to yield actionable insights that can lead to meaningful improvements in the product or interface?"
