Week,Reflection Question,
2,"1. Choose a task of your choice (something you are very familiar with) to explain, and write out a plain language explanation that you could give to someone with a 6th grade education level. For example: how to change a flat tire; how to brew a cup of coffee with a French press; how to set up a wireless router. Use the website 'https://splasho.com/upgoer5/' to write your explanation using only the 1000 most common English language words. \n2. Considering the articles on plain language and legibility in legal documents, discuss how the principles outlined can transform legal communication. Are there specific challenges highlighted in the readings that resonate with you? How do you think that legal technology products should incorporate these principles? Why?",
3,"Considering the increasing trend towards low-code development platforms for legal document automation, such as Gavel, and open-source solutions like Docassemble, analyze the pros and cons of each approach in the context of legal services. How do these platforms differ in terms of customization capabilities, potential for vendor lock-in, and the ability to bridge skill gaps among legal professionals? Furthermore, discuss the implications of these differences for legal aid organizations aiming to implement technological solutions to increase access to justice as well as private law firms.","Given the efficiency gains and productivity improvements discussed so far in class, in this week's readings, and in the 2024 Legal Trends Report, particularly the impact of technology and AI on legal practice, how can tools like Docassemble be leveraged to not only build expert systems but also enhance client-centered legal services? Reflect on the potential challenges and ethical considerations that may arise when integrating such technologies into your practice."
4,"Considering the findings that generative AI tools can significantly enhance legal professionals' productivity and narrow the justice gap, how might the introduction of these tools reshape the professional responsibilities and ethical considerations of legal aid lawyers, particularly in managing risks associated with AI-generated content such as 'hallucinations' or biased outputs? Additionally, given the initial lower usage rates of AI tools among women and the significant improvement post-trial, what steps should legal aid organizations take to ensure equitable access and usage of these technologies across all demographics, including training and support systems to mitigate bias in AI applications?",
5,Reflect on the training materials and examples described in the Docassemble website as well as CourtFormsOnline.org What do you notice about Docassemble as compared to the Gavel platform that we used in Week 3? What concerns and excitement are you feeling as you contemplate learning this platform?,
6,Reflect on the 'Digital Curb Cuts' article that describes the Document Assembly Line project. What are the key takeaways from the article? How do the concepts discussed in the article relate to the readings on legal tech and access to justice? Discuss how the article and the readings have influenced your perspective on the role of technology in legal practice.,
7,"1. Thinking back to the AI lesson in week 4, what AI use cases do you envision that would make sense to incorporate into a Docassemble interview? \n\n2. What factors do you think are most important to consider when you're buying legal technology for your law firm? How would you approach the problem?",
9,How do you think your law firm could use workflow automation? What tasks come to mind as being good ones to start automating? What might be bad to automate? Draw on specific examples from the readings.,
10,"Reflecting on Steve Krug's 'Don't Make Me Think' and the C.R.A.P. design principles, how can the insights from these resources be applied to improve the clarity and effectiveness of legal documents or websites? Additionally, consider the advice from 'How to Write Good Questions': What strategies would you employ to ensure that questions within these legal documents or user interfaces are direct, clear, and easy to understand for all users, regardless of their legal expertise?",How does the term 'earliest testable product' (ETP) relate to the concept of 'minimum viable product' (MVP)? How do the readings suggest that ETPs and MVPs can be used to improve legal services? Discuss how the readings have influenced your perspective on the role of technology in legal practice. How might you apply these concepts in your final project?
11,"Before conducting a usability test, reflect on the primary objectives and methodologies of usability testing based on your studies. What specific aspects of the user experience are you most interested in evaluating, and why?",
12,Come to class ready with 2-3 questions about your project to work on live. What challenges have you encountered? What approaches do you think you can take to solve the challenges you have run into?,
