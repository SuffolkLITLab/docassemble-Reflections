  After reviewing the readings, particularly focusing on McGinnis & Pearce's "The Great Disruption," the explanation of how AI large language models work, the implications of ChatGPT for Legal Services and Society, and skimming through Clio's Legal Trend Report (2023), reflect on the following:


  "How do you envision the role of lawyers evolving in the wake of advancements in AI and machine intelligence, as discussed in the readings? Consider the balance between the opportunities and challenges presented by these technologies. In your reflection, include specific examples or concepts from the readings that support your perspective. Additionally, discuss how these changes might influence your approach to a career in law."

  This is the weekly reflection. Each week, you will be asked to reflect on the readings
