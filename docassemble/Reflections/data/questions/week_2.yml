  1. Choose a task of your choice (something you are very familiar with) to explain, and write out a plain language explanation that you could give to someone with a 6th grade education level. For example: how to change a flat tire; how to brew a cup of coffee with a French press; how to set up a wireless router. Use the website 'https://splasho.com/upgoer5/' to write your explanation using only the 1000 most common English language words. \n2. Considering the articles on plain language and legibility in legal documents, discuss how the principles outlined can transform legal communication. Are there specific challenges highlighted in the readings that resonate with you? How do you think that legal technology products should incorporate these principles? Why?
